## Problem

Concurrency=2 (grouped keep-quant arm at M=2, leaving the f32-exact P==1 decode path) fatals in prefill with 'TT_FATAL: MeshBuffer must be large enough to hold the tensor (assert.hpp:104)' repeated 463x in a retry loop; no tokens produced. Repro: vllm-bench --model /mnt/models/mudler-qwen3.8-27B-APEX-gguf/Qwen3.8-27B-APEX-I-Nano.gguf --num-prompts 2 --input-len 128 --output-len 32 --concurrency 2 --temperature 0 on P150, main@1f46d44e1, env VT_TT_AFFINE_F32=1 VT_TT_NORM_PAD=1 VT_TT_PROGRAM_CACHE=1. Log: /tmp/bench_b3.log. Single-stream (M=1) is clean and token-exact vs the llama.cpp oracle.

## Resolution

- 2026-09-19 (PARTIAL): gdb backtraces (TT_ASSERT_ABORT=1, /tmp/m2_gdb.log,
  /tmp/m2_gdb4.log) located the decode-stage sites: TryPagedAttentionDeviceDecode
  built tt::tt_metal::view metadata views whose spec exceeds the buffer at B>1
  eager — the Q 4D padded view (padded dim1=1 < logical dim1=B,
  tenstorrent_ops.cpp:2787) and the sdpa-output [B,H*D] flatten through the
  free ttnn::reshape (padded=logical -> physical up to 16x the buffer). Each
  fatal was silently caught and the op fell back to the host path. Fixed:
  eager materializes through the free reshape's device program; capture keeps
  the B==1 view; B>1 capture refuses loudly. Red-first unit test
  "kPagedAttention pure-decode batched B=2 keeps the device path" (DeviceShadowExact
  requirement; on base: 1 MeshBuffer fatal + host fallback). Full TT suite
  524,523 assertions green; GDN/PA/capture focused runs green.
- REMAINING (moved to ISSUE-LOCAL-01M2XSWCP507W0M18EXHGR5TGS): the prefill step
  still fatals in RmsNormGatedKernel's gate reshape, then SigmoidGateBf16 OOMs —
  the M=2 e2e does not produce tokens yet. Issue stays OPEN.
